Today we are announcing a [beta preview][tca-obs-beta-discussion] for the biggest change we have 
made to the [Composable Architecture][tca-gh] in its history. We are integrating Swift's Observation 
framework into th libray, and we are doing so that is 100% backwards compatible with the current 
version of the library, _and_ backwards compatible with previous versions of iOS, going all the way 
back to iOS 13.

That's right. Even though `@Observable` is restricted to iOS 17+, we have been able to backport 
those tools specifically for the Composable Architecture. So no matter what version of iOS your
app is currently targeting, you will be able to take advantage of observation and all of the new
tools we have added to the library.

Join us for a quick overview of what these tools look like, and be sure to give the 
[beta][tca-obs-beta-discussion] a spin and let us know if you run into any issues!
